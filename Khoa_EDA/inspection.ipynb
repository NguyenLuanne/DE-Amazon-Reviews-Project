When the salesgirl handed me the CD, I was pleased to see that it actually included thirty pop songs by the likes of Lady Gaga, Usher, La Roux, Katy Perry, Black-Eyed Peas, Ke$ha, etc. I researched more after I got home, and discovered that this Japanese label (Manhattan Records) exists solely to put out rerecorded and remixed dance CDs based on recent pop hits, the key word being rerecorded. I guessed as much as I was listening to the CD in-store; several of the soundalikes do a great job, others are just so-so. It's great for workouts, though, since the tracks fade one into another with no downtime (the bad side is that if you've got in in shuffle, the beginning of the next song, which is often in a different key, is kind of an awkward fade-out when not played in sequence).\",\n",

It shows 1000mg as advertised & another little label says 12mg bc 12 is on the periodic table for magnesium!  I realize not everyone takes chemistry, but 4 ppl liked his review & so misinformation is spreading.  This works. If however you are on opiate level medications that are causing constipation you should talk to your pain dr or your gastrointestinal dr & ask for a medication called Linzess which works must better & must faster, but is unnecessary for most people.  If magnesium is working for you just make sure to take it with food & drink 6-8 glasses of water per day.  Staying hydrated will really help.  Before switching to Linzess I used to take one 1,000 mg pill am & pm every day with meals & always with an 8 ounce glass of water or other liquid.\",\n",

      "  \"text\": \"\\\"Joy of Kosher\\\" magazine fills a much-needed niche for kosher recipes, cookbook reviews, and the kosher lifestyle not found in other mainstream magazines. Sporting beautifully-photographed covers and spreads that are equally at home next to powerhouse food and cooking magazines, \\\"Joy of Kosher\\\" (which merged with Bitayavon in 2012) is your source for all things kosher. Far beyond mere recipes, \\\"Joy of Kosher\\\" includes news on kosher restaurants, kosher wines, cookbooks, kitchen tools, holiday decorating tips, and articles on kosher travel. You'll read interviews with kosher chefs and entrepreneurs and spotlights on new kosher products. Kosher wines and wine pairings are given plenty of space; there are dozens of up-and-coming kosher wineries in Israel (over 70!) and many top-rated wines among them.<br /><br />More than just a cooking magazine (which it does very well), \\\"Joy of Kosher\\\" is a lifestyle magazine; sure, the emphasis is on kosher food and wine, but you'll also find articles on food and health, family outings/activities (such as the \\\"Apple Picking: the Ultimate Family Trip\\\" story from Fall 2013), and traditions. You'll also find articles that explore Jewish beliefs and their relationship to food. And the kosher recipes represent the culinary wealth of the Jewish Diaspora and beyond; you'll find  Italian caponata and herbed spaetzle rubbing elbows with whitefish shu mai dumplings, beef larb, or Moroccan-inspired tagines, along with upscale kosher dishes that mirror current trends. You'll see many articles and recipes from famous chefs in the kosher food world, including Jamie Geller (the \\\"Jewish Rachael Ray\\\" and author of two kosher cookbooks, including [[ASIN:0062207822 Joy of Kosher: Fast, Fresh Family Recipes]]), kosher pastry chef Paula Shoyer (author of [[ASIN:1454907142 The Holiday Kosher Baker: Traditional & Contemporary Holiday Desserts]]), and Chef Laura Frankel (author of my favorite \\\"[[ASIN:0470260890 Jewish Slow Cooker Recipes]]\\\").<br /><br />Most importantly, the recipes are completely approachable using ingredients that should be readily available at your supermarket. Each issue also includes a handy recipe and nutrition guide that features an alphabetical listing of all recipes along with calories, fiber, sodium, carbs, fat and protein; as I watch my fat and calorie intake, I appreciated having this information readily available as not many cooking magazines provide it on a consistent basis (if at all). Recent issues have also put a spotlight on gluten-free and other special diets and a special focus on seasonal foods.<br /><br />One thing you'll quickly notice is that advertising takes up a fair chunk of the magazine; in the Winter 2013 issue, I counted about 25 pages of full and half-page ads (some for other Joy of Kosher products) out of about 83 total. The colorful advertising in many cases blends in fairly seamlessly with the rest of the content.<br /><br />The Joy of Kosher website offers additional articles, recipes, (kosher) cookbook reviews and giveaways that have introduced me to some great new kosher cookbooks (and I was also lucky enough to win an [[ASIN:B0015FLBCA Emile Henry Flame Top 3.7 Quart Tagine, Red]] as part of their \\\"Best of Kosher 2013\\\" contest!). Whether you're looking for new ideas for quick and easy (or international-themed) kosher meals, decorating ideas, or kosher vacation rentals and getaways, you're sure to love \\\"Joy of Kosher\\\"!\",\n",

      "  \"text\": \"I've been addicted to Martha Stewart's Everyday Food for several years, but until recently, I had been buying it by the issue instead of shelling out $30 for a year's subscription.<br /><br />I love the fact that Everyday Food takes everyday ingredients and makes them extraordinary. Example: in a recent issue, 10 different chicken recipes were given, along with a primer on chicken and a wine pairing guide. The included chicken recipes ranged from classics such as chicken tenders, BBQ chicken and chicken club salad to the more exotic Greek chicken cutlets (with feta, olives, tomato and mint) and Indian-spiced braised chicken (ginger, coriander, yogurt, garam masala).<br /><br />Another issue had a divine no-hassle dessert that tasted like a labor-intensive tiramisu: whipped ricotta, sugar, and instant espresso topped with crumbled cookies. Bonus: no raw eggs.<br /><br />Everyday Food also has an eye out for healthier foods, including a focus on whole grains. Another recent issue featured a delicious bulgur breakfast porridge and veggie burgers with tahini mayonnaise. In the back of each issue is an Everyday Pantry checklist perfect for ripping out and taking along to the store. There is also a nutritional guide provided (I liked it better when it was at the rear of each magazine rather than in the front next to the table of contents).<br /><br />In addition, Everyday Food frequently features articles on kitchen tools and appliances that are helpful for novice and experienced cooks alike.<br /><br />My main criticism is that for a slim magazine, roughly 40% consists of distracting print ads. Also, Everyday Food is on the expensive side at $35 for 10 issues. And I liked it better having the nutritional info listed at the back, rather than the front. But these are minor gripes.<br /><br />Compact and colorful, Everyday Food is a wonderful tool for any chef, particularly if you're short on time and you're looking for new ways to spice up your weeknight menus.\",\n",
